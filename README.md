This is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on the Ethereum blockchain using Web3, Solidity, and React. It allows users to create campaigns for fundraising and receive contributions from donors all over the world. All the transactions on the platform are handled by smart contracts, making the whole process transparent, secure, and censorship-resistant.

## Getting Started

To run this application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git or download the ZIP file and extract it.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` in the root directory of the project.
3. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app running.

Note: You need to have an Ethereum wallet (such as MetaMask) installed in your browser and connected to the Ethereum network to use this application.

## Features

- Create fundraising campaigns with a target goal and a deadline.
- Receive contributions from donors in Ether.
- Track the progress of the campaign and see the total amount raised.
- Withdraw the funds when the campaign goal is reached.
- Refund the contributions to the donors if the campaign fails to reach its goal.

## Smart Contracts

This application uses two smart contracts:

- CampaignFactory: This contract is used to create new campaigns on the Ethereum blockchain.
- Campaign: This contract is created for each fundraising campaign and contains all the logic for receiving and managing contributions, and withdrawing or refunding the funds.
